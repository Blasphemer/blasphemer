IT WORKS FOR ME:
* Some users report issues with Doomsday.  Please ensure that your
  version of Doomsday is up to date before reporting errors, as we
  (Stilgar & Jute) have not observed problems.

MAP BUGS/ISSUES:
* Some texture misaligns/misfits on E1M3, especially switches.
* Some texture misaligns on E2M1.
* Looking through the "window" behind the start on E1M3 shows sky tiling.
* Stepping up towards the door and turning around at start of E1M7 shows
  sky tiling at bottom.
* Lava behind start of E1M7 is inescapable pit.

MISC BUGS:
* DEHACKED lump crashes Vavoom engine - required dehinfo.txt (Vavoom's
  problem?)

MISC ISSUES:
* Torchstick is not fullbright, walltorch is.  But torchstick uses flame colors
  that look best in fullbright, and walltorch doesn't.  Recoloring advised.
* Fire brazier animation could use a bit of cleanup.
* Mellow's lava (FLATHUH*) jerks when animating.

CAN'T FIX:
* Some ports don't properly read COLORMAP and therefore don't show the
  proper invulnerability effect (grey/red). Solution: Use a more accurate
  port where possible.
* Key marker objects look really bad when jammed under ceilings too
  short for them.  This is a result of mapping error and not unique to
  Blasphemer, but Blasphemer's key marker graphics are acutely affected
  due to their reliance on careful sprite alignment matching.
  Solution: Fix your map.
* Sounds don't sound right in the HHeretic engine.  This would appear to be
  an HHeretic problem.  HHeretic is NOT recommended at the current time
  anyway, because it lacks the limit removal that some Blasphemer maps
  require.

WON'T FIX:
* Heretic PWADs with custom textures will mess up the existing texture
  entries, due to differing patch sizes/layouts.  Not fixable without remaking
  the patches to fit the sizes/layouts of the Heretic ones. (PWADs without
  redefined textures work fine.)
