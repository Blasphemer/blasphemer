Blasphemer's graphics use a customized 256-color palette; colors outside this palette will not appear correctly.  For ease of creating graphics for the project, both the source downloads and release downloads offer two palette files:

  * A .gpl palette file for The GIMP.
  * A .gif file that contains the palette both as its image and as a .gif palette that might be converted to a format convenient to other graphics programs.

NB: Most engines will probably expect the episode 2 finale screen to use a different palette than the one used by other graphics.  This particular resource is not currently a high priority, and the alternate palette could end up being a duplicate of the standard one.
